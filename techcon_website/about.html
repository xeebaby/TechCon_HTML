            <h1>History</h1>
        <p>TechCon began in 2015 as a small regional developer meetup in Austin, Texas, 
            founded by a group of passionate engineers who envisioned a space where tech 
            enthusiasts could share ideas, collaborate, and inspire one another. 
            The first event welcomed just 150 attendees, featuring grassroots workshops and 
            open-source showcases. Over the years, TechCon has evolved into a global stage for 
            innovation, drawing thousands of participants from across the world. Each year has 
            marked a milestone — from introducing live-streamed keynotes in 2017 to launching 
            the Women in Tech Summit in 2019 and going fully hybrid during the 2020 pandemic. 
            Today, TechCon stands as a beacon for the tech community, spotlighting breakthroughs 
            in AI, Web3, sustainability, and digital transformation. Historical images from past 
            events — from humble classroom-style beginnings to today's packed auditoriums and 
            cutting-edge expo halls — reflect the journey of how a simple idea grew into one 
            of the most anticipated tech events of the year.
